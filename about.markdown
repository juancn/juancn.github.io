My name is Juan Cruz Nores, I've been passionately doing software development since I was eight, professionally since 1997.
I've spent most of my career building software for other engineers (compilers, frameworks, APIs, concurrency libraries, RPC mechanisms, query engines, distributed systems, etc.).

This site is a collection of various ramblings over a long time. Some posts have been migrated [from blogger](https://codeknot.blogspot.com/) and other platforms, so they may contain some mistakes.

For more detailed professional information I keep my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-cruz-nores-213198/) fairly up-to-date.
