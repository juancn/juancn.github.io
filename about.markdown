My name is Juan Cruz Nores, I've been passionately doing software development since I was eight, professionally since 1997.

This site is a collection of ramblings, I've spent most of my career building software for other engineers (compilers, frameworks, APIs, concurrency libraries, RPC mechanisms, query engines, distributed systems, etc.).

For more detailed professional information I keep my [LinkedIn profile](http://ar.linkedin.com/pub/juan-cruz-nores/0/198/213) fairly up-to-date.
